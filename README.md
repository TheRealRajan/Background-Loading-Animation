# Background-Loading-Animation
A card background that animates before actual content gets loaded into it.<br><br>

This is to demonstrate that the card occupies the allocated space on the page even when the actual content hasn't loaded onto the page and preserves the layout structure.<br><br>
The demo is live at *https://therealrajan.github.io/Background-Loading-Animation/*
